ok SO !!! the broad goal of this whole thing is to update all (counting) 259(what the fuck) actions to use EP4's new action display system . thing so it looks Not Garbage

HOWEVER::the thought of doing all of this by myself is A Nightmare, so my hope is that i can use this repo to do it collaboratively :qouverjoyous:

please keep in mind !! i have barely used github before and have little to no idea how any of this works :P i am shrimply trying my best out here

TODO::
	
 	- update All The Actions with EP4's stuff (pain)
	
 	- fix the bug with the ADD_WINDUP related code that's breaking the action change stuff in /::FRAME/
 	
  	- other miscellaneous bug fixes/typos/balance changes/whatever :P


ok that's all thank you !!!!
